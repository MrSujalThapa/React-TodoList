Constructed a backend server with Node.js, MongoDB, passport.js, and Express, combined with a React frontend, to
securely create ToDo's, store user information, and ensure user security.

Implemented secure crud functionality using MongoDB, passport.js, and joi, to protect routes and ensure data integrity. Used the useEffect hook for 
protected routes - implemented router and outlet to check when the app is re-rendered, sending a request to the backend to check if the user is authroized.

Transformed the UI/UX with Material UI, React.js, and CSS to create a modern interface, increasing user engagement.

Current Features:
- Authentication (from scratch) - speciffically login, signup, and logout
- Complete CRUD functionality
- Session cookies to ensure authorization
- error handling



Going to update this todoList soon to implement features such as:
- Archieved Todo's
- Evaluate a user's performance based on how many todo's they complete per month/week
- Intergrate Cohere or a different ai model to provide suggestions of other todo's based on a user's list (if authorized)
- Host the app to create a dataset of the number of user's that utilize the app
- Give advice on how to increase productivity and completion of todo's
- Extract user data -speciffically the ratio of todo's completed vs created to optimize suggestions and advice to see what is the most impactful prompts.
